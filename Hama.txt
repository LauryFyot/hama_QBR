marketplaces in 2024 of 13.6 percent and in France the decline is very very similar to the overall
Hama decline we have seen as well it's a little bit less than it's like 600 bips less than the
sorry 60 bips less than the rest of the marketplaces um but yeah I think that a
having like the loss feature offered decreasing year over year as well in 2024
may have helped as well and also we have seen a big increase of 256 bips of ad spend in France
as well so I think that both factors made that the decrease in France may have been like a bit less
than the rest of the marketplaces but overall what happened in France for Hama in 2024 was
we have seen Hama across all marketplaces as well um so there's nothing like French specific
I would say um however in 2025 we're seeing um a very big declining peacocks here today for
Hama France versus Hama total performance as you can see there we're declining almost 40 percent
year over year versus the 18 percent were declining for all Hama marketplace for the other Hama
marketplaces um we had a lot of asyls offline at the beginning of the year in January more
specifically most of the asyls affected were inside the PC category the PCGL and I was looking
and it seems that PC is one of always between the top GL or the second best
GL the biggest GL for Hama in France so I could understand that this may have affected
the peacocks decline like deeply um since we had a very portion of the PCA since offline due to
profitability issues in that's true that in January sorry if I interrupt you in January
yeah we had this big decline everywhere in every country so it was not something that I was
uh yeah yeah very uh annoyed with because of course it was everywhere so we we knew that it
was due to the asyns that were offline but it continues in February and March so now I'm really
a little bit worried yeah yeah yeah just on yeah just on this one so to give you an oversight into
January so in terms of peacocks so our product was the goods sold we've climbed nearly 44 percent
in January um that was our obviously that was impacted by the reduced visibility of certain
asyns but from February onwards we're at minus 32 percent so it's still a huge decline um which
is obviously a massive concern for us but it has reduced we've seen about probably 12 percent uh
taken off from the fact that the visibility has been increased again so we need to look at obviously
what's been happening um on those asyns since February so to give you some of the top offenders
specifically that are impacting and driving this because I think this is the thing as Lola just
mentioned PC um is one of the top offending categories for this so we need to look at what
asyns and what's happened to them directly on a whole and what impact that is having
an asyn that actually stands out quite a lot is I'll just share it with you
is that some files that you can send after the meeting yeah so what we can do is we can send
you a file with all the top offenders and you can see the year-on-year basics applied so you
can have that as an overview um but the what's actually impacting a fair bit is power strips
but actually looking at the of how they're performing and what's going on they the buy
box has been there consistently but we are seeing some price increases so for example
just send your screenshot so this is like not an official Amazon tool so this is essentially
keeper which is just an add-on um that you might have as well I don't see that I don't know if
you are sharing something but I don't see any I'm just I'm just sending you a file into the chat
oh okay can you see this now yes okay this is for example one of the ASPs of the asyns so up until
mid-march we were sitting around 90 was the price of 20 euros now we've actually gone up to 25 80
at the current market price um and then we're seeing a sharp decline since the price increased
and that's offsetting and increasing the amount of decline that we're seeing
even if it's only 10 days that creates quite a massive offset exactly yeah I've noticed this
also but it's something on your hand we don't cannot do anything about the the least price you
you offer Amazon I mean and I saw that yeah there are a lot of increase everywhere it's like uh
spread it everywhere every since so um there is no yeah okay this is yeah well I'm seeing
basically so actually this asyn specifically I can see the list price is 1999 which you've
obviously said yourself um however we're matching a 26 6p um so the tempting issue in terms of why
it's not factor in the list price because we shouldn't be going above the list price basically
um loader I think on this one we need to look at the mapping of this
and see what's driving it to actually go higher than the list price um it is possible this can
happen because it will look at basically the selling price across the market and if it sees
it a higher ASP it will assume that the list price should be higher um so we need to need to
find a way to look at that more closely Lola um but it's definitely that's fine let us look into
this um specifically on an asyn level but what we will do is we'll send you a list overview but
it looks to be honest that potentially the ASP is getting too much in France and it's not actually
we're not seeing as much it's not competitive enough um the specific asyns which is seeing
a drop um because for example if you think about power strips the amount of competitors that we
have in terms of not in terms of like the same product and a different retailer but in terms of
your competitors um that you're seeing who actually sell power strips as well they're basically going
exactly and I've not I've noticed that they have uh sometimes at the same level of price
uh they have much more features also so that they win they I mean our competitors are
better than us because uh at the same level of price they have uh um yeah more uh some some
usb plugs or something more uh so so we we need to have a lower price because otherwise it's
it's impossible to to to compete those guys and those products yeah and this yeah and this is
the thing and it's I think especially in certain products and this is why I like um pc is quite a
high up offender because it's products that a lot of retailers a lot of distributors sell um also
the asp since February has gone up four percent year on year so it might look small but actually
on a scale of things that's quite large um so essentially the catalog is getting higher and
higher in price um so I think on our side what we need to do is we need to look into the list
price issue and why we're actually selling the products above the list price that you're providing
us with um so that's kind of the first takeaway from our from an amazon side um on your side what
we would do is we'll we'll share the top offenders with you um within this I will show the decline
um that we're seeing on the asm I'll also show you the year on year for the asp yeah to kind of see
the trend of what's happening yeah um with that price and that's really important to help you
understand what to do in that situation um on a whole what we also need to take into account
that harmer as a whole is not performing the best right now we in terms of amazon so we are seeing
an increase um as in compared to last year we are actually doing better but we had quite a lot
of reduced visibility last year so last year isn't the best compensation for this year um so that's
also what we need to be mindful of um but we are starting to break the gap from what we had offline
in january so it's getting is becoming a better situation um but kind of february wasn't a great
month to be honest so we are still seeing the impact across the board in all marketplaces
but it's just france we need to find a way to unlock it um we do see in terms of growth for
the whole of kind of amazon we see pretty much all marketplaces growing quicker than france
so france is actually probably our toughest marketplace at the minute across the board
so that's also creating difficulties on top um and the fact is we basically probably have less
competitors in france which is meaning that we actually don't follow the pricing as much
which means that actually the prices are staying higher um which obviously the prices are low we're
not getting the increased amount of sales um but other brands are obviously consistently getting
that lower price so we have to find a way for the middle ground where we keep profitability high
as well as basically the sales which is a really tough thing to to crack um the positive note is
that loss feature offer isn't super high so we are not having many issues in terms of having to
fight for the buy box um which if loss feature offers are like 20 for example that's a really
difficult issue to deal with and resolve because we're basically having to be more aggressive in
the market and compete better with competitors um so that's a positive not having a massively
high loss feature offer um but we do need to look at the ace level and what's happening there
specifically so i will send you an overview um after this call and then we can maybe align um
hopefully next week's quite busy for the spring gil days but we could align the week after um and
go through and have a look at the ace and lift list collectively and kind of think of a plan
of action for the top offenders um and see what we want to do there would be my suggestion
because also your ad spend is quite good in france it's not like yeah reducing the kind
of investment in that marketplace exactly we we spend we didn't we were not doing ads but we we
started last year uh end of 2023 and uh we have good results we are spending a lot of money there
but anyhow um so it's a good help but uh we need to to to improve our sellout and
otherwise we are we are losing money it means it means that we have a lot of charges here with the
paying ads and everything and and finally the sellout is not growing so we have to find
what is what is yeah what is the issue it seems to be the least price but it's
maybe not the only but things but could be this i know that we have to improve our contents and
we work a lot on this also but uh on the other hand about this we we had raised the question
that why we why when we do any modification it's not uh going online
it seems that's the question of elevation or i i've not really understood the situation but
it seems that there is elevation has my brand has been already elevated so contributions from now
on words seems that's you're right because yesterday i did some modification and it was
online today so i crossed my fingers that it will continue like this because
until now it was really hard horrible it could to yeah yeah yeah i yeah i had to talk to yeah
it looks like something like two weeks sometimes or more and we had to do it manually and then
open cases and a lot of time so uh so now it's seems to be better i i've not checked everything
but i i've started yesterday and i did the modification it was working so hopefully it
will uh yeah it will continue uh okay great uh so yeah i i'm looking forward the the file and i will
uh try to work on it to see uh to see uh in our side if we can do something
so it's good to have the uh sap of last year and this year so that we can compare
do you want us to give you again a list of our srps or it's it's not i think so we
because i noticed that sometimes you are not aligned with our srp so
okay well what we can do is if you have a whole list of the srps for france
we can re-upload those um in the system to make sure that it's fully correct and fully aligned
with you um obviously the issue where we're matching above the list price um that's completely on our
side to resolve um and we need to look into why that's happening um but if we if we have
your full list prices um we can get shivan as a vendor consultant to basically upload these
and make sure they're all fully aligned um that's absolutely fine and then i think also in terms of
growth aside from regular run rate we probably need to look at opportunities in france so
naturally we we see that it's quite a tough marketplace to crack to be honest in terms of
it's seen some good growth over the years but that's kind of flattening a little bit now
so we we need to find a way to push that and drive that and one of those is probably brand
awareness for yourselves in france um so for example it's not just fully about beating
competitors in price it's about obviously the brand name and and getting that awareness towards
them so we need to look at ways potentially which we are actually speaking directly with
nicholas and peter about um just opportunities uh in terms of retail marketing to expand that
and add more visibility to the to certain products and that could that could help give
the added push that's necessary um to increase rankings so the products have shown higher
and drive just essentially awareness so customers um hear about the hammer brand in that marketplace
yes because obviously we see a massive market share in germany whereas other marketplaces
are smaller in terms of the market share so one of our goals is to reduce the impact of germany
not obviously the the total amount in germany but the percentage share we want that to be
given to other marketplaces where possible um so one of those is about driving the brand awareness
ultimately so it'd be good to look at forward-looking kind of methods that we could do
to grow the market um it's not just about obviously mastering the pricing there's so
many aspects to to get this right and get the customer to convert this product um so it would
be good to look into those options as well as time goes on um and obviously we're working
with nicholas and peter on that anyway but obviously one of the focuses of that is france
of course thanks that's a good idea uh very good yeah that's completely um true about the brand
awareness in france it's very low uh we need to work on that and but it's not all in my hand
it's not all about amazon it's a low global solution and yeah uh we have on amazon we have
the competition with hammer beats you know the hammer this is also could could be an issue i
don't know they are really working massively uh the this this brand so could be some confusion
between us and them and yeah so for example if we type in hammer um we are seeing a lot of
hammer beats at the minute um and this obviously comes down to so the brand elevation has been
done um which we're hoping helps but then also it comes down to their key wording so with hammer
they're winning the keywords on hammer basically the only product we really see of you let me just
share my screen
so when we actually search hammer
we are essentially um the sponsors are coming up so in terms of your ad spend
but everything else um is hammer beats yeah that is obviously a big issue because people that are
actually who already have the brand awareness are searching hammer by name and looking for
certain products that influences but then also there's another side to factor in is
because you do such a diverse and wide range of products would a customer really just search
um because for example if it's a brand that does one specific category then someone might just type
in the brand name to see what they can offer but in terms of your case it's possible that people
would search for example hammer power strip and this should hopefully yeah so this takes you all
to hammer at the beginning um which is good because sometimes you can type in a brand name
and then type in power strip after and then you would sometimes see like belkin first um
depending on what keywords they have and so on but you're in good positions when people
search the actual type of product they want which is most likely what the customer is actually doing
but that doesn't mean that it's ideal that obviously when you search hammer hammer beats
is coming up so we have to find a way to win that but in terms of customer journey in terms
of these type of products we do see that the customer is more often than not searching for
if they want a brand they'll search the brand and the type of product they want as well but in
the next part that obviously we need to unlock as well is when you just type in power strip so
that's for example in a way more essential than the hammer beats issue exactly because this is
where most people what they want and this is where we want to win right and this is where you're not
coming up as well so that's something that we should probably try and find a solution for but
this is there's so many factors it comes into ranking um where you rank compared to it if you
look at some of these products so one one k plus bought in the past month um so it's about how do
we compare to that and what can we do to increase the sales to compete with these products so i think
in terms of your armor power strip on page four yeah so there's this one has 100 plus so this is
likely your best ranked one but these ones they don't have anything saying 100 plus which means
they are selling less than 100 per month so that is obviously why they're not ranking high as well
so that's something we need to look into is how how can we increase those specific signals for
these agents so you will you will help us to understand how to do so with this one it's
basically about we need to increase the sellout um so it'd be good to pick certain aces where
we're seeing a decline um and putting more ad spend towards those aces individually maybe on
sponsored ads um to try and increase that sellout rate and then once we start getting the ranking
they will more often than not stick around to the top and then the organic sales will happen
alongside it so that's something that we need to focus on one thing that can boost this is
obviously deals um one thing i'm discussing at the minute with nicholas and peter directly is what
we call always on deals so we would have like rotations of deals with the minimum discount
so we wouldn't be heavily discounted products it would just be the minimum five percent off
um this would then basically take it to the deals page which would be under our deals here
and then it would give the increased visibility for a five five percent off offer and then hopefully
that increases sales and then in turn that will increase this ranking so when it's not actually
on deal so that's a method that we can utilize to try and increase the run rate of these aces
um and then try and win the search ranking when we type in power strip for example um
but the issue is we have so much competition for example tessanne is quite
the big one in the market now to be fair um and they and also what they are doing as you can see
is they're running deals right now so the deal that they're doing is tiny so it's for example
their lowest price in the last 30 days was 23.99 they're running the deal 21.59
so basically they're probably going for the minimum discount that they can do
to get this increased visibility which has taken them right to the top
that means that we cannot always we don't have enough margin in our site to to do
we have tried to do more deals than previously every year we we try to do our best and to add
more deals but it's very very tough because we don't have enough margin here and we cannot do
sometimes the the soa you you ask is too high it's impossible to yeah so
unlike tier one event the the margin has to be higher um because essentially we have to go for
a bigger discount to meet the deal tenants but if we do kind of what these the brands are doing
which is basically just business as usual so it's not going on any deal event
um all they have to do is hit five percent off so it's just funding so one thing that's good
to choose is probably the the more profitable asians so for example when we were actually at
the net ppm target if we choose those specific ones with ones that we want to increase the
run rate of then the actual soa support will be requesting will just be to cover the five percent
so if we're already doing profitable asians and then we go for the minimum discount the request
will be a lot lower than we're requesting on previous tier one events so that's something
that we can look into we are working with nick as a Peter on kind of a proposal at the minute
so there will be one going to you on france which you can obviously have a look at and then see if
it works for you but that's also a good opportunity i would say and as you can see a lot of brands are
doing this which is definitely helping them and then when it's off deal their sales rank
and has been increased from the sales history okay okay yeah we can try it for a short period
yeah uh could help yeah so we're having the proposal i think in about two three weeks over
to nipras and peter so they'll forward something on to you and then we'll have a look but in the
meantime we will send you an overview of the the asians and which ones are basically producing the
most pecans but the time in the most and then we'll show the asp trend as well and any relevant
data as well alongside that um we'll share that with you this week and then hopefully that will
help to kind of pinpoint what asians are causing this decline and having the largest impact
can you also have a look to the albums because we were uh we are decreasing a lot on picture
frames and albums and i don't know if it's because we have some marketplace sellers or
i don't know what's happening there but uh it's very strange that
we were much more stronger on albums and picture frames than this year
yeah definitely in terms of just give you a quick overview we are seeing a decline across the board
so it's not just france specifically on on albums and so on um for example when we've had them on
deal events for example they've just not been performing um so there's definitely something
that's impacting that and i think it's just the aggression and the and the kind of busy marketplace
that we're seeing now um there's a lot of players in the market for those type of products which is
making it a lot harder to get competitive pricing uh towards the customer so but yeah we obviously
within the list that we sent you okay and also uh is it possible for you to give us some insights
about what then if for example albums are not doing well globally what are the categories or
products that are increasing through amazon so that we can try to see if we have
some products similar so that we can uh list them
if they are not yeah so what we can do is we can yeah so we can look at basically the the most
performing categories and probably not just the best performance but the ones that are seeing the
most growth yeah the most growth in terms of where right yeah so where we're seeing the ones having
the big year-on-year jumps that's probably the best market to kind of invest into and jump into
so yeah we'll have a look and we'll have a look at specific categories um and we'll see basically
have any selection that might fit into this um it also means you might already have the selection
but it might be the right selection to try and unlock and increase investment into and then we
can obviously hopefully see the uptake in in return on that um yeah of course okay great
perfect perfect yeah
so i think what we do is we'll send that information by end of week um
especially the ace in this is the top offenders and then we will
reconnect in the coming weeks on this topic um and try and kind of build a plan for this
fine great okay thanks is there anything else from your side no i think it's all for today
okay no worries thank you so much thanks so much for your time
and no worries we'll catch up again by email and then we'll have another call okay thanks
thank you thank you so much bye
